- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jing Qi. a fresh graduate from the University of Edinburgh, holding a bachelor degree, BSc (Hons) Biological Sciences (Genetics). 
I first started to use Github for my honours project to develop a better bioinformatics workflow to quantify the interaction between RNA and protein ([nf_CRACpipeline](https://github.com/JingQiChong/nf_CRACpipeline)).
